# Code Implementation Guidelines

## Directory Structure

* Organize code logic into appropriate directory structures based on functionality
* Separate concerns by creating dedicated modules for different aspects of the application
* Use a clear and consistent directory naming convention
* Group related files and functionalities together in the same directory
* Avoid deep nesting of directories that might complicate navigation
* Core business logic should be isolated from infrastructure and presentation layers
