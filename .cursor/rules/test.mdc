## Testing Guidelines

- Tests should be executed using Jest
- Test subject code should be properly extracted and isolated
- Create a dedicated directory for each module with test code in the same directory
- Develop both integration tests (for verifying results from large text inputs) and unit tests
- Do not run slack api in tests.
